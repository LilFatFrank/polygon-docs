Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is a modular, open source software toolkit for blockchain developers which supports the installation and configuration of a variety of chain architectures. Polygon CDK empowers developers to launch new L2 chains running Polygon zkEVM technology on Ethereum or, in the future, transition existing Layer 1 (L1) chains into ZK-EVM L2s. 

## CDK features

Polygon CDK provides the components necessary to build a layer 2 blockchain that is secure, scalable, and interoperable with other chains. Below are some of the key features of the CDK:

- Security: Build high-performance, high-security, scalable L2s that utilize the latest innovations in zero-knowledge technology such as [plonky3](https://docs.polygon.technology/learn/plonky/?h=plonky3#plonky-3).

- Scalability: Transaction fees are orders of magnitude lower and processed substantially faster compared to Ethereum. Enabling a fast, cheap, and secure user experience unaffected by any extraneous high activity experienced on shared networks.

- Modularity: As logic is separated into modular components, developers can easily customize all components of the L2 to build a chain that meets their specific needs.

- Interoperability: Opt-in to the [AggLayer](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/glossary/#agglayer-v1-al1) to bootstrap your chain&rsquo;s ecosystem, enable cross-chain transactions, and access to the users and liquidity of other chains.

- Sovereignty: Maintain full control over your chain&rsquo;s revenue, governance, security, economic policies, and more.

## Dive deeper into the CDK

Polygon CDK gives developers a toolkit for sovereign and modular chain design, without sacrificing future interoperability with other L2 chains. Chains built with Polygon CDK can access an ecosystem of (forthcoming) unified liquidity, optimized performance, and seamless asset transfers, all while prioritizing user experience and data security.
